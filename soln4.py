#  GOAL:
#  Your goal is to move the dozer to the base using self.robot.moveForward(), self.robot.turnRight()
#  and 2 for loops.  A for loop looks like this:
#  for x in range(0, 2):  OR  for x in range(2):
#  This will loop 2 times.
#  Remember to indent everything using a tab that you would like to repeat in the loop.
#  Here is an example of a double for loop printing hello 100 times:
#  for x in range(0,10):
#      for y in range(0,10):
#          print("hello")
#          print(x, y)


class AI:
    def __init__(self):
        print("solnf AI loaded")

    def turn(self):
        #  Your code goes here.
        #  Make sure that you indent properly
        #  Please use 2 for loops and a single  
        #   self.robot.moveForward() and self.robot.moveRight()
        #  command.
        #  Start below the line
